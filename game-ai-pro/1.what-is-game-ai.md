# What is game AI?

## Creating an Experience
- Maximizing chances of success or just being fun
- **Making a particular experience** 

## Suspension of disbelief

> the player’s mind will come up with explanations for the AI’s decisions


## Reactivity, Nondeterminism, Authorial Control

Simply program the behavior, designer, and designing a heuristic for showing excitement.

- Best decision making approaches: Heuristic (Utility based) for strategy games like Sims and Zoo Tycoon

- Being reactive; sense the environment and select actions
![authorial control and reactivity](https://github.com/URAmiRBin/artificial-stupidity/assets/42384597/43abc8e8-828f-4d9b-af57-00d8b69c000b)


The more scripted, the more predictable

Nondeterminism, Randomness while also being reasonable

## Simplicity and Scalability

> “Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it”

- Authorial control
- Avoidance of artificial stupidity

The basic decision making algorithms are quite simple, FSM, BT, Weight-based random, goal oriented action planning

## Tricks and Cheats

Should we make the AI stronger? Economic bonus, information about the player ...

Warcraft AI does not have to think about strategy of generating units and directing them, in the game the enemy units are only spawned at the edge of the fog. The goal is to create a great battle, not a fair strategy game.

The cheating is only to make the player experience more rich.
