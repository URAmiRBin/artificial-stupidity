# Informing Game AI through the Study of Neurology

## Neurology

- The output of AI dev is _behaviour_

Nervous system, is made out of one very fundamental cell; _the nueoron_

### The Electrical Processing Myth
our notion of this electrical signal is really just a view of the voltage at a single point on the neuron's ce;; membrance.

This notion happens because the semipermeable cell membrance separates different concentrations of ions, and being thin.

### The Neuron at Rest
Conditions for neuron rest:
- Net charge on either side of the cell membrance must be zero
- The concentrations of solute particles inside and outside must balance
